# Your first component

Welcome to the **@vuetify/v0** tutorial! This interactive guide will walk you through building components with headless composables.

## What is v0?

`@vuetify/v0` provides **headless** Vue 3 composables — logic-only building blocks with no opinions on styling. You bring your own design system.

## The editor

On the right, you can see a code editor (top) and a live preview (bottom). The code you write is compiled and rendered in real-time.

## Let's start

Right now, the editor shows a simple Vue component with a heading. In the next step, we'll add interactivity using `createStep` — a composable for building step-based navigation.

> [!TIP] Try editing the text in `App.vue` and watch the preview update instantly!
