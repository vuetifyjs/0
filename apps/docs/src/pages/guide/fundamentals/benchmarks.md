# Benchmarks

v0 maintains performance benchmarks for all core composables. This page explains what gets benchmarked, how to interpret metrics, and what the performance tiers mean.

<DocsPageFeatures :frontmatter />

## Why Benchmark

Headless UI libraries must be fast—they're foundational infrastructure. v0 benchmarks exist to:

1. **Catch regressions** — CI fails if performance drops
2. **Guide optimization** — Data-driven decisions, not guesses
3. **Set expectations** — Users know what to expect at scale
4. **Validate minimal reactivity** — Prove the tradeoffs are worth it

## What Gets Benchmarked

### Core Composables

| Composable | Why It's Benchmarked |
| - | - |
| `createRegistry` | Foundation for all collections—performance here affects everything |
| `createModel` | Value store underlying all selection—selection benchmarks depend on it |
| `createSelection` | Base for all selection patterns—select, toggle, mandatory, batch |
| `createNested` | Hierarchical trees with cascade—tree traversal scales with depth |
| `createTokens` | Design tokens can grow large—alias resolution must scale |
| `createFilter` | Search/filter on large datasets must remain responsive |
| `createVirtual` | Virtual scrolling is performance-critical by definition |
| `createDataTable` | Composed orchestrator—measures sorting, filtering, and pagination together |
| `createDataGrid` | Composed on top of createDataTable—measures column layout, cell editing, row ordering, and row spanning overhead |
| `createSortable` | Ordered-list primitive—move, swap, and reorder operations must scale to large lists |
| `useDate` | Date operations are frequent in UIs |
| `useProxyRegistry` | Reactive proxy for templates—shows reactivity overhead vs raw registry |

### Operation Categories

Each benchmark file covers multiple operation types:

| Category | Fixture Type | What It Measures |
| - | - | - |
| Initialization | Fresh | Setup/creation cost |
| Lookup operations | Shared | Single item access (O(1) expected) |
| Mutation operations | Fresh | Updates and modifications |
| Batch operations | Fresh | Bulk actions (onboard, offboard) |
| Computed access | Shared | Cached/derived value reads |
| Seek operations | Shared | Directional search |

**Shared fixtures** reuse the same data structure across iterations—safe for read-only operations.

**Fresh fixtures** create new data per iteration—required for mutations to get accurate measurements.

Each benchmark is assigned a tier based on its throughput and detected complexity. Group tiers are the average of their individual benchmark tiers.

### Complexity Detection

Tiers adjust based on detected algorithmic complexity. Detection checks the benchmark name against patterns **in order** and uses the first match—so the check order matters as much as the patterns themselves:

| Order | Pattern in Benchmark Name | Complexity |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | "nested", "recursive", or "all ... all" | O(n²) |
| 2 | Number + items/objects/entries/elements | O(n) |
| 3 | "all items" or "all keys" | O(n) |
| 4 | "single" or "one item/query/key" | O(1) |
| 5 | No pattern matched | O(n) — conservative fallback |

"Nested"/"recursive" checks run first so a benchmark like "recursive lookup (single item)" is classified O(n²), not O(1)—the more expensive complexity wins on ambiguous names.

### Reading Results

```bash
✓ createRegistry/index.bench.ts
  lookup operations
    ✓ Get by id (1,000 items)          1,234,567 ops/s
    ✓ Get by id (10,000 items)         1,198,432 ops/s
```

- **ops/s** — Operations per second (higher is better)
- **Consistent across sizes** — O(1) complexity confirmed
- **10x data, ~same speed** — Good scaling behavior

## Dataset Sizes

Benchmarks test multiple sizes to reveal complexity:

| Size | Items | Purpose |
| - | - | - |
| Medium | 1,000 | Baseline measurement |
| Large | 10,000 | Reveals O(n) vs O(1) |
| Small | 100 | Optional edge case |
| Stress | 100,000 | Optional stress test |

If a 10,000-item benchmark is 10x slower than 1,000-item, the operation is O(n). If it's roughly the same speed, it's O(1).

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
pnpm test:bench

# Run specific file
pnpm vitest bench packages/0/src/composables/createRegistry/index.bench.ts

# Generate metrics report
pnpm metrics
```

## Interpreting for Your Use Case

::: faq single
??? Is this fast enough for my app?

Most v0 composables handle 10,000+ items at interactive speeds (>60fps). For typical UIs:

- **<100 items** — Instant, no optimization needed
- **100-1,000 items** — Smooth, standard usage
- **1,000-10,000 items** — Consider virtual scrolling
- **10,000+ items** — Use `createVirtual`, paginate, or filter

??? Should I use events or polling?

- **Events** — Real-time updates, notifications, debugging
- **Polling (`values()`)** — Periodic snapshots, non-critical freshness
- **`useProxyRegistry`** — Template-bound lists that must stay current

Events add minimal overhead when enabled. Benchmarks show raw operation cost; event emission adds ~1-5% overhead.

??? Why minimal reactivity instead of full reactivity?

Vue's reactivity system is powerful but not free. Each reactive wrapper adds:

- Memory for dependency tracking
- CPU cycles for change detection
- Potential for unnecessary re-renders

By keeping reactivity minimal, v0 composables stay predictable—you know exactly what triggers updates. When you need reactivity, opt in explicitly with `useProxyRegistry`.

??? How do I compare raw vs reactive performance?

Compare `createRegistry` benchmarks with `useProxyRegistry` to see the reactivity overhead. It's worth it when needed, but shouldn't be the default.

## Contributing Benchmarks

New composables should include benchmarks if they:

- Manage collections (registries, arrays, maps)
- Perform search/filter operations
- Have user-perceived latency (loading, transitions)
- Are called frequently (every render, every keystroke)

See [createRegistry benchmarks](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/0/blob/master/packages/0/src/composables/createRegistry/index.bench.ts) for the canonical example.
