# Switch

A switch for on/off state or multi-selection groups with tri-state support.

<DocsPageFeatures :frontmatter />

## Usage

::: gn-example

:::

## Anatomy

```vue Anatomy no-filename
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { Switch } from '@vuetify/v0'
</script>

<template>
  <Switch.Root>
    <Switch.Track>
      <Switch.Thumb />
    </Switch.Track>

    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>

  <Switch.Group>
    <Switch.SelectAll>
      <Switch.Track>
        <Switch.Thumb />
      </Switch.Track>
    </Switch.SelectAll>

    <Switch.Root>
      <Switch.Track>
        <Switch.Thumb />
      </Switch.Track>
    </Switch.Root>
  </Switch.Group>
</template>
```

## Examples

::: gn-example
/components/switch/useSettings.ts 1
/components/switch/SettingsPanel.vue 2
/components/switch/settings-panel.vue 3

### App Settings Panel

A notification preferences panel that groups four independent switches under a master "Enable all" lever and submits the result through a `Form`. Each `Switch.Root` carries a `name` prop, so v0 auto-renders a hidden native input and the toggled values participate in `FormData` — there is no `Switch.HiddenInput` to place by hand. The panel pairs each switch with a label and a line of helper text, and a summary line below echoes the saved selection.

The interesting piece is the master toggle. `Switch.SelectAll` is not a group item — it never registers a value into the array v-model. Instead it reads the group's aggregate `isAllSelected` / `isMixed` state and calls `toggleAll`, so it renders checked when every setting is on, unchecked when all are off, and indeterminate (`aria-checked="mixed"`, `data-state="indeterminate"`) when only some are on. The tri-state and batch operations come straight from [createGroup](/composables/selection/create-group) — the same multi-selection logic that powers [Group](/components/providers/group). The thumb is animated through `data-[state=...]` variants on the `Switch.Track` rather than a transform from the off position, because `Switch.Thumb` is `visibility: hidden` when off and cannot animate in from there.

Reach for this pattern for any settings surface — notification preferences, feature flags, privacy controls — where a list of independent on/off toggles needs a single shared model, a select-all lever, and form submission. Because `Form`'s `@submit` is pass-through (it fires on every native submit regardless of validity), the handler guards on `payload.valid` before committing the saved state. See [Form](/components/forms/form) for the validation surface and [Checkbox](/components/forms/checkbox) for the equivalent committed-selection control.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `useSettings.ts` | Composable — setting definitions, the enabled-array model, and the guarded save/reset logic |
| `SettingsPanel.vue` | Reusable component — renders the `Form`, the `Switch.Group` with a `SelectAll` master and per-row label + helper text, owns the UnoCSS classes |
| `settings-panel.vue` | Entry — wires the composable to the panel and renders the saved-state summary line |

## Recipes

### Form Integration

Pass the `name` prop on `Switch.Root` and a hidden native `<input type="checkbox">` is rendered automatically — no `Switch.HiddenInput` placement is required. The input is visually hidden, `inert`, and `tabindex="-1"`, so it only participates in `FormData` submission:

```vue
<template>
  <Switch.Root name="notifications" value="on">
    <Switch.Track>
      <Switch.Thumb />
    </Switch.Track>
  </Switch.Root>
</template>
```

`Switch.HiddenInput` is exported as an internal building block for custom layouts, but auto-rendering via `name` is the only supported form integration path — placing `Switch.HiddenInput` as a child of a `Switch.Root` that already has a `name` will produce two hidden inputs.

### Styling with Data Attributes

Switch subcomponents expose data attributes for CSS styling without conditional classes. `Switch.Root` and `Switch.SelectAll` emit both `data-state` and `data-disabled`, while `Switch.Track` and `Switch.Thumb` emit only `data-state` (they inherit disabled styling from the Root ancestor):

| Attribute | Values | Components |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| `data-state` | `checked`, `unchecked`, `indeterminate` | `Root`, `SelectAll`, `Track`, `Thumb` |
| `data-disabled` | `true` | `Root`, `SelectAll` |

```vue
<template>
  <Switch.Root class="data-[disabled]:opacity-50">
    <Switch.Track class="bg-gray-300 transition-colors data-[state=checked]:bg-primary">
      <Switch.Thumb />
    </Switch.Track>
  </Switch.Root>
</template>
```

`Switch.Thumb` applies an inline `visibility: hidden` when unchecked, so the thumb is not visible until the switch is on. This means a sliding transform on `Switch.Thumb` cannot animate *from* the "off" position. Animate the `Switch.Track` background color instead, as shown above.

## Accessibility

The Switch.Root component renders as a button and handles all ARIA attributes automatically:

- `role="switch"` for proper semantics
- `aria-checked` reflects state (`true`, `false`, or `"mixed"`)
- `aria-disabled` when switch is disabled
- `aria-label` from the `label` prop
- `tabindex="0"` for keyboard focus (removed when disabled)
- Space key toggles the switch (Enter works when rendered as button)

For custom implementations, use `renderless` mode and bind the `attrs` slot prop to your element:

```vue
<template>
  <Switch.Root v-slot="{ attrs }" renderless>
    <div v-bind="attrs">
      <!-- Custom switch visual -->
    </div>
  </Switch.Root>
</template>
```

::: faq

??? When should I use Switch vs Checkbox?

Use `Switch` for settings that take immediate effect, like toggling a feature on or off (WiFi, notifications, dark mode). Use `Checkbox` for selections that are committed later — form submissions, multi-select lists, and "I agree" confirmations. The ARIA roles (`switch` vs `checkbox`) communicate this intent to assistive technology.

??? Why does my form submission miss the switch value?

`Switch.Root` only renders the hidden native input when a `name` prop is set. Without `name`, the switch is purely visual and won't appear in `FormData`. Add `name="myField"` (and optionally `value`) to participate in form submission.

??? How do I animate the switch state change?

`Switch.Thumb` applies an inline `visibility: hidden` when unchecked, so transforms on the thumb cannot animate from the "off" position. Apply a CSS `transition` to `Switch.Track` and use the `data-[state=checked]:` variant to change its background — for example, `class="transition-colors bg-gray-300 data-[state=checked]:bg-primary"`. No JavaScript event handling is needed — the data attribute flip drives the animation.

??? Can I use Switch.Root without the Track and Thumb subcomponents?

Yes. `Switch.Track` and `Switch.Thumb` are purely cosmetic — they read switch state from context to render the rail and knob. You can omit them entirely and render your own visual using the `attrs` slot prop on `Switch.Root`, or use `renderless` mode for full control over the rendered element.
