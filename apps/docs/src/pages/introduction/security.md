# Security Disclosure

<DocsPageFeatures :frontmatter />

The Vuetify team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, email [security@vuetifyjs.com](mailto:security@vuetifyjs.com?subject=SECURITY) and include the word **"SECURITY"** in the subject line.

**Please include:**

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

## What to Expect

1. **Initial Response** — We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation** — We will investigate and keep you informed of progress
3. **Resolution** — We will prepare and release fixes as quickly as possible
4. **Credit** — We will credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report, we will:

- Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
- Audit code to find any similar issues
- Prepare fixes for all maintained releases
- Release fixes to npm as quickly as possible

## Third-Party Dependencies

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the maintainers of those modules. You can also report vulnerabilities through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).

## Scope

This policy applies to the `@vuetify/v0` package and related packages in the [vuetifyjs/0](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/0) repository.
