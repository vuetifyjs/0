fix(security): apply prototype-pollution and CSS-injection guards flagged in the security review

- `useFeatures` adapters (LaunchDarkly / Flagsmith / PostHog) now skip `UNSAFE_KEYS` (`__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype`) flag names when building the flags object, matching the guard already used by `mergeDeep`, `usePermissions`, and `createTokens`
- `useLocale` `restore()` validates the persisted value with `isString` / `isNumber` guards before applying it instead of blind-casting `saved as ID`, completing the persist/restore sweep (`useTheme` and `useRtl` now use the same guards)
- `ThemeAdapter`'s `UNSAFE_CSS` denylist is hardened against declaration injection: it now also rejects `;`, `\` (CSS escape evasion), and the URL-loading functions `src()` / `image()` / `image-set()` / `cross-fade()`
- `V0Error` filters `UNSAFE_KEYS` when copying caller-supplied error details onto the instance
